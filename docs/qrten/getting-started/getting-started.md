## Theme requirements

Our theme is optimized for PHP 8+ and WordPress 6.3+, ensuring peak performance, security, and access to the latest features. We have tested it with Mac, Windows and Linux. Below is a list of items you should ensure your host can comply with.

#### Recommended PHP configuration limits

White screen, demo content fails when importing, empty page content and other similar issues are all related to low PHP configuration limits. The solution is to increase the PHP limits. You can do this on your own, or contact your web host and ask them to increase those limits to a minimum as follows:

-   max_input_vars = 3000
-   memory_limit = 128M
-   max_execution_time = 300
-   max_input_time = 300
-   upload_max_filesize = 64M
-   post_max_size = 64M

## Importing demo content

Using the WordPress Import tool, you can import demo content into your site from an xml file. The `demo.xml` can be found in the downloaded file from ThemeForest (Please download the **All files and documentation**).

#### Before importing

If the file you’re importing is too large, your server may run out of memory when you import it. If this happens, you’ll see an error like "**Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted.**"

If you have sufficient permissions on the server, you can edit the php.ini file to increase the available memory. Alternatively, you could ask your hosting provider to do this. Otherwise, you can edit your import file and save it as several smaller files, then import each one.

If your import process fails, it still may create some content. When you resolve the error and try again, you may create duplicate data. Review your site after a failed import and remove records as necessary to avoid this.

**You might not need a demo import** because all of the demo's components are already included as templates. Simply navigate to the Site Editor and build a page using a predefined template. [Go to the next step](setting-up)
