**Patterns** in the Gutenberg editor are pre-designed block layouts that you can quickly insert into your pages or posts. These patterns allow you to create beautifully structured content without having to manually design each element from scratch. They are a great way to speed up your workflow, providing consistent, well-organized sections for your website.

The purpose of using patterns is to simplify the process of building pages by offering ready-to-use layouts that you can customize to fit your brand and style.
